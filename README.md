# OCR medical insurance document classifier

It focusses on a Document/Text Classification solution for an Insurance industry client which focussed on grouping medical/health insurance claims into pre-defined categories. The current process of categorization was manually done by a panel of experts.These experts had their own biasness and heuristics, which lead to inconsistencies.We developed a Deep Learning based framework which ensembled learnings from Document layout and structure, the content/text and amalgamation of consistent & coherent expert opinions. The framework helped in automation of the existing process leading to better efficiency and efficacy. We had a set of 40k scanned images of medical insurance documents and tried building an algorithm to classify those documents into given 5 categories. These scanned documents exhibited characteristics for each of the classes based on the document structure and token sequences present
in the document.

The provided codes were tested on sample data.
